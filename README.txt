The Windows version of Basic4GL was originally created by Tom Mulgrew in 2003. 
Development originally began on a Linux version in 2006. Another Linux version 
which used SDL was made in 2006 too. A Mac version is also being created by 
James Campbell. 

Work on both the Linux versions by Jon Snape & Davy Wybiral stalled in 2007 
while the Windows version of Basic4GL continued to be improved until 2008. 
Another Windows version which could be compiled from source using MinGW was 
also in development but it hasn't been updated for some time.

In 2012 it was decided by Josh Koert to start work on a new multiplatform 
version. He was helped with compilation & library creation by Matthew Webb & 
James Campbell helped with setting the project up on GitHub. There are 
currently three people working on this project but we welcome help & code 
contributions from anyone.
